                "> If there's content from communities you don't want to see, then [**switch your default view type to `Subscribed`**](https://lemmynsfw.com/settings). You can also **block** the communities you don't wish to interact with **at all**. Also for finding communities combining those existing in the fediverse as well as within this instance, use [lemmyverse.net/communities](https://lemmyverse.net/communities)\n\n::: spoiler Rules\nBefore you start participating, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our rules:\n\n1. (Rule One) 🔞 **Age Requirement**: All users and lurkers MUST be age 18 or over.\n  \n-  a. Posting content involving any person who is under 18 is strictly **forbidden**. This includes real, drawn, and fictional content.\n-  b. **All loli/shota/cub** or similar content is strictly **forbidden**.\n\n2. (Rule Two)  **Respect and Consent**: Treat all members with respect and obtain consent when sharing explicit content involving others. No doxxing. No soliciting or sharing personal info. No homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, or kinkshaming. **Don’t be an asshole.**\n\n3. (Rule Three) **No NSFL/Gore/Snuff Content**: We strictly **forbid** the sharing or promotion of NSFL (Not Safe For Life) or gore content. **This includes fictional snuff scenarios.**\n\n4. (Rule Four) **No Bestiality/Zoophilia**: We strictly **forbid** any NSFW content involving animals.\n\n5. (Rule Five) **No Non-Consensual Content**: We strictly **forbid** content made or released **without consent** of everyone in the content, including revenge porn / deepfakes / leaked content / NC / true voyeur / rape content.\n\n6. (Rule Six) **No Illegal Content**: - We strictly **forbid** promotion and detailed discussion of things that are broadly illegal in most of the world, like murder, animal cruelty, money laundering, and so on. Our policy on mind-altering substances is more complicated – [see the FAQ (its in the table of contents to the right). ](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/faq/)\n  \n-  a. Solicitation of sexual services (either way, asking or offering) is strictly forbidden. [(why?)](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/policy/solictation/)\n\n7. (Rule Seven) **NSFW Flag**: All NSFW communities and posts **must be flagged** as NSFW.\n\n8. (Rule Eight) **No Rules Lawyering: Admin decisions are final and arguing with them can result in a suspension or banning of your account and removal of your content.** (if you feel a community is not being sufficiently moderated or properly following these guidelines, please contact an admin.)\n\n9. (Rule Nine) **Don't Spam Posts**: Please only post a few posts to a community at a time. You may mean well by posting several posts at once, but because of lemmy's limited algorithms this will saturate the feeds of many people on this instance and other instances. \n\n  - What is considered spamming will be left up to the admins/mods, but if you've made more than 10 posts at a time in a single community, consider waiting until a later time to continue posting to that community. \n\n - Please limit cross posting the same image to 5 times or less\n\n  - Spamming may result in a 1 day or longer community or sitewide ban depending on the severity and if it's a repeated offense.\n\nIf any material is ambiguous or borderline forbidden content, **we’re usually going to err on the side of caution.** Please use your common sense. \n\nThis is a condensed form of our rules. If you want to read further discussion into the rules above, our reasonings behind our decisions, general knowledge about the instance and things generally our team would like you to know [please click here to visit our docs page](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/).\n\n**All users and communities must follow and respect these general instance-wide rules. Any violations could result in suspension or banning of your account or community and purging of your content.**\n\n\n:::\n\n::: spoiler Community Guidelines\n1. **Stay Relevant**: Share relevant content in the relevant communities and ensure your content complies with the rules of those communities.\n\n2. **Self-Promotion**: Self-Promotion is only okay as long as the community you are posting in allows it, and you don’t spam it.\n\n3. **Content Sourcing** - We would strongly prefer all content be credited and sourced if possible, to make it easier to keep CSAM and noncon off of the instance. [See the FAQ for more info.](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/faq/) \n\n4. **Furry Content** - Furry content is allowed (unless it conflicts with any other rules) but furries may be better served at https://pawb.social/ or https://yiffit.net/.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler Temporary Rules\nBecause of technical limitations of the Lemmy platform, we are forced to implement some restrictions on content. These are restrictions that don’t necessarily fit with our larger philosophy. **We hope to revise this section** once Lemmy evolves as a platform and moderation tools improve.\n\n1. **NSFW User Avatar**: NSFW user avatars are prohibited as it is currently not possible to mark users as NSFW. NSFW user banners are also prohibited.\n\n2. **Temporary Content Restrictions**: The following content is temporarily restricted: Hot lunch (🤮), blood, scat, CNC. \n\nIf you are the admin of another instance and you have any issues with Lemmy NSFW please raise it with one of our admins so we can communicate on how we can improve this instance. We would prefer to work with you before either of us consider defederation.\n:::\n\n___\n# Contact\n###### Mail: contact@lemmynsfw.com\n###### Mastodon: [@lemmynsfw@mastodon.world](https://mastodon.world/@lemmynsfw)\n###### Matrix public operations room (SFW only): [#lemmynsfw:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#lemmynsfw:matrix.org)\n\n___\n# [Donations](https://lemmynsfw.com/post/87160)",

The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that lemm.ee does not own or control, or to individuals that lemm.ee does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.** \n\n**You also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on lemm.ee, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**:  When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n \n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to authenticate users.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content will be sent to other federated servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history.

                'This privacy policy describes how sh.itjust.works ("sh.itjust.works", "SJW", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the sh.itjust.works website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that SJW does not own or control, or to individuals that SJW does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.** \n\n**You also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on SJW, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**:  When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n \n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 30 days. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service. \n\nWe have additionally taken precautions to the best of our abilities to implement some other widely used industry best practices towards instance hardening and run daily encrypted remote backups.\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 30 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 30 days.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\nIn addition we retain a rolling 14 day backup policy on the entire instance.\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.',

                "### Welcome to Lemmy.ca!\n\n\"Lemmy.ca\" is so named due to it running the [Lemmy software](https://join-lemmy.org/), in [the Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), and it's geared toward Canadians, hosted in Canada, and run by Canadians. It is, however, not at all restricted to Canadians, or Canadian culture/topics/etc. All are welcome!\n\nWe are run by the non-profit [Fedecan](https://fedecan.ca/) and funded entirely by user donations. You can help support us by visiting our [donations page](https://fedecan.ca/donate).\n\n#### We have some rules here:\n\n::: spoiler 1. No Bigotry\nIncluding racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, or xenophobia.\n:::  \n::: spoiler 2. Be Civil\nArgue in good faith, attack the argument; not the person, and promote a healthy debate. That includes implying violence, threats or wishes of violence and/or death.\n:::  \n::: spoiler 3. No Porn\nThis instance is not made to host porn communities. You're free to access porn communities on other instances through your account, but be mindful of Rule 4.\n:::  \n::: spoiler 4. Use the NSFW tag\nUse your common sense: if you wouldn't want this image to show up on your work computer, tag it as such. In comments, use the `:::spoiler :::` tag for NSFW images, and put a NSFW mention beside links.\n:::  \n::: spoiler 5. No Ads / Spam\nThis instance is not there to act as your billboard. If you want to promote your personal work, at least make the effort to be a contributing member of this community. Your account purpose shouldn't be to only advertise, make it natural.\n:::  \n::: spoiler 6. Bot account\nIf you are the operator of a \"bot\" account, make sure to flag is as such in the [account's settings](/settings).\n:::  \n::: spoiler 7. Right to privacy\nDo NOT distribute the personal information of someone else without their consent (aka doxxing). Information that is public domain can be shared, provided it is in good faith.   \n*ex: The official email of an elected official is fair, the private phone number or the real name of a non-public person is NOT.*\n:::  \n::: spoiler 8. Report abuse\nThe report function isn't labelled the *disagree* button. You might not agree with someone, but that doesn't mean what the person says is against the rules. Using it repeately in this fashion will lead to actions being taken against the reporter.\n:::  \n::: spoiler 9. Impersonation\nDon't make an account with the intent to negatively deceive or defame someone on the fediverse.  \n*ex: Parody of a famous person is okay, submitting outrageous content as appearing like another user, mod or admin isn't.*  \n:::  \n\n\n\n#### Getting Started\n\n- [Lemmy Community Browser](https://browse.feddit.de/)\n- [Lemmy Community Explorer](https://lemmyverse.net/communities)\n\n#### Site resources\n\n- Main community at !main@lemmy.ca\n- Support at !lemmy_ca_support@lemmy.ca\n- Uptime history at [status.lemmy.ca](https://status.lemmy.ca/)\n- Mlmym interface at [old.lemmy.ca](https://old.lemmy.ca/)\n- Voyager interface at [voyager.lemmy.ca](https://voyager.lemmy.ca/)\n- Photon interface at [photon.lemmy.ca](https://photon.lemmy.ca/)\n- Alexandrite interface at [alex.lemmy.ca](https://alex.lemmy.ca)\n\nNeed to contact an admin?

If you're already a matrix user, you can head straight to our application room https://matrix.to/#/#gv-apply:chat.blahaj.zone, or by searching for #gv-apply:chat.blahaj.zone from within your matrix client.\n\nIf you're new to matrix, you can find some more details and an instruction video on how to get up and running here https://chat.blahaj.zone/c/genderverse/\n\n**Community Guidelines**\n\nBlåhaj Lemmy is a space where everyone should feel able to participate safely, and to that end, our community is built on the guiding philosophies of empathy, inclusion and acceptance. \n\n*Empathy*\n\nWe want our community members to be guided by compassion and empathy for others. \n\nExamples of behaviour that are contrary to this philosophy are personal attacks, insults, doxing etc. If your comment is designed to hurt someone, this isn't the space for it.\n\n*Inclusion and Acceptance*\n\nEmbracing inclusion and acceptance means listening when people tell you who they are and what their needs are. It means not telling people that you know their experiences better than they do. It means not gatekeeping experiences of identities of others. It means no bigotry such as racism, sexism, anti LGBT commentary, ableism etc. It means doing your best to ensure that you don't over-talk the voices of folk who don't share your privileges.\n\n**Supporting Blåhaj Lemmy**\n\nAfter much hesitation, [we have a Ko Fi](https://ko-fi.com/blahajzone) to enable people to help with supporting some of the running costs associated with our instances. \n\nProviding a safe space for our community is the goal, so please only consider donating if you are in a position to do so without *any* financial stress. \n\n**Mascot and logo**\n\nFind out about our mascot Shonky (they/them) who appears on our site logo [here](https://github.com/blahaj-zone/shonky).\n\n--",

The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal\ninformation and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your\nengagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and\naccessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that\nLemmygrad.ml does not own or control, or to individuals that Lemmygrad.ml does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging\nspace of free open communication on the internet.  **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING\nTHAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY\nEXPERIMENTAL.  ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR\nPERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM\nDEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.** \n\n**You also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP\naddress. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your *engagement* (your\nprofile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that\nproper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to\nengage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on\nLemmygrad.ml, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you will be asked to enter a\n  username, a password, an optionally an e-mail address. You may also enter additional profile\n  information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username,\n  display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**:  When you post, the date\n  and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain\n  media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly.\n  Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is\n  available publicly. Your posts, comments and votes are delivered to the communities they are\n  posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored\n  there. When you delete posts, comments and votes, this is likewise broadcast to other instances,\n  however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all\n  instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting\n  record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you\n  subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are\n  not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions\n  which result in it becoming publicly viewable. This service interoperates with other federated\n  services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function\n  differently than it does on Lemmy.  \n  **In essence, your email address remains private to this local instance, however due to the nature\n  of federated services all *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be\n  considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do\n  not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n* **Direct messages**: **Direct messages are stored as plain text in the PostgreSQL database. For\n  encrypted communication, please use a dedicated platform like Matrix.** In some cases, messages\n  are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to\n  limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail\n  to do so.  Therefore it's important to review the instances of users you are engaging with.\n  **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such\n  messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share\n  any sensitive information over Lemmy direct messages.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we do not record the IP address you log in from. We\n  retain the name of your browser application. We may retain server logs which do not include the IP\n  address from which requests are made to the server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people's content and\n  post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities\n  for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other\n  people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or\n  other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when\nyou enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as\nwell as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password\nis hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has\nmitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance\nbackend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service.\n\nThe PostgreSQL database is regularly back up by the instance administrators.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that third-party clients will not steal the user's login credentials. When using\na client other than the official web client (located at https://lemmygrad.ml). it is the user's\nreponsibility to secure their credentials. Using a trusted, open-source client helps with this.\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe do not retain the IP addresses of the users of our instance.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all\ninstances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard\ndrive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your\nbrowser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable\ninformation. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site,\nconducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information\nconfidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply\nwith the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community\nposts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to\nthe servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different\nserver than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you\napprove, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and\nyour voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API,\nhowever it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nIf this server is in the EU or the EEA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people\nwho are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR\n(General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\nIf this server is in the USA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at\nleast 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, per the requirements of COPPA (Children's Online\nPrivacy Protection Act) do not use this site.\n\nLaw requirements can be different if this server is in another jurisdiction.\n\n---\n\nThis document is CC-BY-SA.

                'This privacy policy describes how Sopuli ("Sopuli", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the Sopuli website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that Sopuli does not own or control, or to individuals that Sopuli does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n**You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on Sopuli, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service **OR** hosts the PostgreSQL database on a separate server and connects via a secure tunnel. All incoming and outgoing network access to the PostgreSQL server outside of this secured tunnel has been blocked\n\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\n---\n\nThis document is CC-BY-SA.

And thank you for choosing to signup to Reddthat!  \nWe are a community that has formed around a few key ideals:\n- Being respectful to everyone!\n- Engaging in thoughtful conversations\n- Sharing what we love about the internet\n- Remembering the human\n\nWe also have a few NSFW communities on reddthat, so if you click on the \"Show NSFW content\" you agree that you are **over the age of 18** and are willing to see NSFW content. (This can be changed in your settings at a later date)\n\nIf this sounds great to you, please follow the next steps to ensure that your application is accepted!\n\n## Before continuing please make sure you:\n\n- Read the rules: [over here](https://reddthat.com/post/9701)\n- Include a community or two you would like to join in the application section below: [list of communities](https://reddthat.com/communities)\n- **AND** also include how many subscribers they have (as a way to prove you are human!)\n\nThank you for your understanding and we cannot wait to see your application. \n\nCheers,  \nThe Reddthat Admin Team\n\n\n----\n# FAQ:\n\n## When will my application be accepted?\nApplications are usually acted upon within 1 hour, but may take longer as it is a manual process. \n\n## How will I know if it's been accepted or denied?\n\nIf you add an email address to your account you will be sent an email when it has been accepted. Emails are only sent upon being accepted. You will not be emailed upon denial.\n\n## I don't want to add an email addresses when you signup, so how will I know?\n\nThat is perfect! Thank you for not giving us your email address. We do not want your email address and we are happy not knowing it and even happier knowing less about you! \n\nPlease attempt to login with the credentials you used, after an hour or two, and at worst, the next day. If you still cannot login, then your account was denied, most likely because you did not read the process above. That is how confident this FAQ is. It happens too often!\n\n## I never received an email/still can't login. What happened?\n\nIf you cannot login to your account, then that means you were denied. Please feel free to attempt to signup again and make sure you follow the above 2 requirements! \n\n## I have no idea what to put in the box below?\n\nPlease read this text in it's entirety, it explains what you need to include there.",

The idea is to have a fast, stable instance and allow users to subscribe to whatever content they want from here. \n\n😎  We dont block any other instances. We will keep it that way unless it becomes a moderation problem.\n\n🤠 We will be around for a very long time, so you dont have to worry about us shutting down the instance anytime soon. We like performance and stability in our servers, and will upgrade the instance when its needed.\n\n🥹 Make sure to join **a lot** of remote communities to get a good feed going. How to do that is explained [here](https://lemmy.today/post/168392).\n\n#### Lemmy mobile apps\n\nYou should start using one of these ASAP since the web browser user interface is quite ugly, even with themes. \n\n- [Sync for Lemmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.syncapps.lemmy_sync) (Android)\n- [Boost for Lemmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.lemmy) (Android)\n- [Eternity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.toldi.infinityforlemmy&hl=en&gl=US) (Android)\n- [Liftoff](https://github.com/liftoff-app/liftoff) (Android and IOS)\n- [Voyager](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voyager-for-lemmy/id6451429762) (IOS)\n- [Voyager WebApp](https://vger.app/posts/lemmy.today/all)\n- [Jerboa](https://github.com/dessalines/jerboa) (Android)\n- [Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kuroneko.lemmy_connect) (Android)\n- [Thunder](https://github.com/thunder-app/thunder) (Android and IOS)\n- [Mlem](https://github.com/mlemgroup/mormaer-mlem) (IOS)\n- [Memmy](https://github.com/Memmy-App/memmy) (IOS)\n\n#### Optional Lemmy web browser user interfaces\n\n- https://old.lemmy.today\n- https://photon.lemmy.today\n- https://m.lemmy.today\n- https://alexandrite.lemmy.today\n\n#### Rules\n\n- Be respectful.

Potete aprire una richiesta [cliccando qui](https://feddit.it/c/main), spiegando di cosa parlerà la comunità e come sarà gestita.\n\n📜 Ogni comunità sceglierà in autonomia le sue regole, i suoi moderatori e le sue esigenze. Non sarà tuttavia possibile aprire comunità con contenuti pornografici, illegali o con discriminazioni razziali o di genere.\n\n🚯 Le comunità politiche dovranno accettare e sottoscrivere una clausola sull'antifascismo.\n\n⛔️ Lo spam, i bot e i messaggi ripetuti o molesti saranno rimossi a prescindere dalle regole della comunità.\n\n♻️ Le comunità che non riusciranno ad auto-moderarsi verranno richiamate dagli admin e se non sarà possibile trovare una soluzione verranno eliminate.\n\n#### Come si mantiene Feddit?\n\n🧡 È un progetto indipendente e senza pubblicità, se volete potete aiutare la gestione di questo server con una piccola [donazione ricorrente su LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/Feddit-it) oppure con una [donazione una tantum su Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fedditit).\n\nGrazie! 🧡\n\n📧 Per informazioni sull'istanza potete scrivere a lemmy@feddit.it",

                "### Privacy policy\n\n\nForniamo questa informativa ai sensi del Regolamento UE 2016/679 (GDPR) per coloro che consultano il sito https://feddit.it e chiedono di registrarsi. Si precisa che l'informativa è resa solo per tale sito e non anche per altri siti web eventualmente consultati dall'utente tramite link.\n\n### Titolare del trattamento\n\nTitolare del trattamento è Francesco Macchia\n\nemail: francesco.macchia [at] gmail .it \n\n### Quali dati vengono raccolti.\n\nRiguardo a questo punto, dobbiamo distinguere due passaggi.\n\n(a) Registrazione nella community: nome utente, password ed e-mail;\n\n(b) Accesso alla comunità e attività dell'utente: indirizzo IP, nome utente, password ed e-mail.\n\nI dati dell'utente (username, password ed email) vengono registrati nel database e, nello specifico, le password vengono convertite in “hash” (ovvero trasformate in stringhe alfanumeriche mediante la funzione hash).\n\n### Accesso alla comunità e alle attività degli utenti\n\nDopo aver completato il processo di creazione dell'account, l'utente può accedere (Login) alla comunità tramite il browser, quindi viene acquisito l'indirizzo IP.\n\n*Ogni utente è responsabile dei contenuti che intende pubblicare sulla community di feddit.it.*\n\nIn questa fase, i dati personali degli utenti raccolti sono *username , password , indirizzo email e indirizzo IP.*\n\n### Chi può accedere ai dati e per quali attività.\n\nL'amministratore del server (istanza) può leggere i dati delle attività svolte sulla community registrati sul server e precisamente nel database o nei file di log (username, email, indirizzo IP, indirizzo web della community, tipo di attività - tecnicamente GET o POST).\n\nL'amministratore accede ai dati personali degli utenti solo per motivi strettamente tecnici (analisi del sistema, aggiornamento dei pacchetti applicativi, esigenze di manutenzione).\n\nSi precisa che l'accesso ai dati personali degli utenti, sia nel database che nei log, è un'attività specifica che generalmente non viene svolta se non per risolvere conflitti o errori particolari.\n\n### Le finalità del trattamento.\n\nLo scopo è consultare questo sito web o interagire pubblicando contenuti, commenti o creando altre community. L'accesso a questo sito Web e la richiesta di registrazione come utente implicano che l'utente ha prestato il proprio consenso.\n\nInoltre, le finalità sono anche legate alla manutenzione dei server e agli aggiornamenti di sistemi e applicazioni.\n\nL'invio facoltativo, esplicito e volontario di posta elettronica agli indirizzi indicati su questo sito comporta la successiva acquisizione dell'indirizzo del mittente, necessario per le risposte, nonché degli eventuali altri dati personali inseriti nella missiva. Tali dati sono trattati per rispondere ai messaggi inviati e gestire le relative richieste. Il mancato conferimento dei dati personali per le comunicazioni con noi o l'invio di richieste impedirà di evaderli. Conserviamo i dati per il tempo strettamente necessario alle finalità legate al trattamento dei dati.\n\n### Base giuridica del trattamento\n\nIl trattamento dei dati personali è basato sul consenso - ai sensi dell'art. 6, par. 1, lettera a) del Regolamento UE 2016/679 - espressa dall'utente con la navigazione in questo sito web e la sua consultazione, accettando così la presente informativa.\n\nIl consenso è facoltativo, e l'utente può revocarlo in qualsiasi momento mediante richiesta inviata via email all'indirizzo francesco.macchia [at] gmail.com , precisando che, in tal caso, qualora l'utente non acconsenta, non potrà consultare il presente sito web, né registrarsi né rimanere come utente registrato.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la manutenzione dei server e gli aggiornamenti di sistemi e applicazioni, la base giuridica è il legittimo interesse ai sensi dell'articolo 6, lettera f) del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\nIl trattamento dei dati personali è necessario per il perseguimento del legittimo interesse del titolare del trattamento a fornire informazioni in merito a studi e ricerche, ai sensi dell'art. 6, par. 1, lettera f) del Regolamento UE 2016/679, in conformità a quanto previsto dal medesimo Regolamento.\n\n### Cookies\n\nGli unici cookie sono *solo quelli funzionali* e, quindi, nessuna attività di profilazione o tracciamento.\n\n*Pertanto, questo sito non utilizza cookie diversi dai cookie funzionali esclusivamente per le finalità funzionali sopra descritte e la loro installazione non richiede il consenso dell'utente.*\n\n### Destinatari dei dati\n\nNon comunichiamo a destinatari o categorie di destinatari i dati personali raccolti da questo sito web a seguito della sua consultazione.\n\n### Periodo di conservazione dei dati personali\n\nA parte quanto sopra specificato, i dati raccolti da questo sito durante il suo funzionamento sono conservati per il tempo strettamente necessario alle attività precisate. I dati saranno cancellati o anonimizzati alla data di scadenza a meno che non sussistano altre finalità di conservazione degli stessi. Per scopi di analisi (statistiche), utilizziamo Matomo ma a condizione che tu abbia acconsentito a ciò fornendo il consenso una volta raggiunto questo sito.\n\n### Trasferimento di dati personali verso un paese terzo o un'organizzazione internazionale\n\nIl sito feddit.it, in quanto completamente basato sul progetto Lemmy, dispone di un sistema che consente di generare un feed per ciascun oggetto della comunità. I dati riportati nel messaggio non sono costituiti da dati personali e consistono in:\n\n- username dell'utente\n\n- Titolo del post\n\n- Identificativo della comunità feddit nella quale è stato pubblicato\n\n- Data di pubblicazione\n\n- Testo del messaggio\n\n- Link pubblicato dall'autore del messaggio\n\n- Link del messaggio\n\nQuesta peculiarità della piattaforma Lemmy e il fatto che tali dati non possano essere considerati come \"dati personali\" consente a chiunque di operare un trattamento massivo e automatizzato di tali dati, per qualunque fine consentito dalla normativa nazionale ed europea.\nAttualmente esiste già un sistema di ripubblicazione automatica che provvede a copiare sul canale Telegram https://t.me/feddit e sul profilo Twitter https://twitter.com/feddit_it tutti i post di apertura pubblicati all'interno delle comunità.\n\nResta fermo il fatto che il titolare del trattamento, l'amministratore dell'istanza di Lemmy, non trasferisce i dati al di fuori dello Spazio Economico Europeo (SEE) dal momento che Lemmy è installato sul server situato all'interno dello Spazio Economico Europeo.\n\nCi sembra opportuno chiarire meglio.\n\nGli utenti registrati su un'istanza sono sempre gli unici responsabili delle loro attività creando comunità o pubblicando post o commenti.\n\nNon vi è alcun trasferimento al di fuori del SEE quando gli utenti registrati su un'istanza all'interno dello stesso SEE eseguono attività sullo stesso server (istanza). Ad esempio, la nostra istanza ( https://feddit.it) si trova in Italia e quindi all'interno del SEE. Se gli utenti registrati sulla nostra istanza eseguono attività sul nostro server, non vi è alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE. Allo stesso modo, non vi è alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE anche se gli utenti registrati sulla nostra istanza si iscrivono, pubblicano post o commenti su altre istanze, ad esempio, situate al di fuori del SEE. Infatti, in quest'ultimo caso, il nostro amministratore di istanza può accedere ai log e vedere solo il dominio (e quindi nemmeno l'URL completo della community su cui si svolgono le attività) e il suo indirizzo IP. Nessun ulteriore dato dell'utente viene trasferito al di fuori del SEE dall'amministratore o automaticamente dalla piattaforma Lemmy. L'utente deve essere consapevole che il proprio nome utente è costituito nella forma \"@username@domainofcommunity\" (ad esempio, nel nostro caso, @username@feddit.it.\n\nNon ci sarà alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE anche se l'utente intende creare una comunità sull'istanza Lemmy esistente all'interno dello stesso SEE.\n\nTutto questo perché è una funzione propria del sistema fediverse e del protocollo ActivityPub utilizzato da Lemmy.\n\n### Misure di sicurezza\n\nI dati dei visitatori o degli utenti sono trattati in modo lecito e secondo correttezza, adottando le opportune misure di sicurezza volte ad impedire accessi non autorizzati, divulgazione, modifica o distruzione non autorizzata dei dati. I tuoi dati nella sessione di comunicazione con questo sito Web sono protetti da un certificato Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) che utilizza un protocollo di presentazione crittografico, crittografando le informazioni.\n\n### Diritti degli interessati\n\nGli utenti (interessati) di questo sito web possono esercitare i diritti di cui agli artt. da 15 a 22 del Regolamento UE 2016/679. Puoi inoltrare tutte le richieste per esercitare tali diritti scrivendo a francesco.macchia [at] gmail.com\n\n### Diritto di sporgere denuncia\n\nQualora l'interessato ritenga che il trattamento dei dati personali che lo riguardano effettuato attraverso questo sito violi il Regolamento, ha il diritto di proporre reclamo al Garante ai sensi dell'art. 77 del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\n### Attribuzione\n\nParti di questi termini di servizio sono state prese da eupolicy.social e adattate da https://mastodon.nicfab.it/privacy-policy#Informativa_Privacy_IT.",

                '## Terms of Use\n\nBy interacting with AniSocial, through direct means, third-party apps, or federation, you agree to the terms and conditions set by this TOU.\n\nAny part of the TOU may change without prior notice. The date in which the TOU changes is indicated on the footer of this document.\n\nThe TOU applies to the interaction of AniSocial users with federated instances. Likewise, be aware that many federated instances also have their own terms and policies which must be observed by all AniSocial users when interacting with these instances. The TOU applies to the interaction of users in AniSocial from other federated instances.\n\nBy interacting with the instance, you agree to the following:\n\n1. You will not interfere with, disrupt, or damage the instance and its associated services.\n\n2. You will not deceptively impersonate another person or entity.\n\n3. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.\n\n4. By enabling "Show NSFW", you are 18 years old or the equivalent legal age of your jurisdiction and you agree to see content that is "Not Safe for Work".\n\nAdditionally, you will abide by AniSocial\'s policies, such as the Content Policy, the Privacy olicy, the Bot Policy, and the Federation Policy, which may be found within this document.\n\n### Content Policy\n\nThe Content Policy is an overview of what submissions are allowed in AniSocial to regulate the general well-being of the instance.\n\nContent is hereby defined as any user-submitted text or media including, but not limited to, avatars, icons, banners, links, posts, comments, and private messages.\n\nThe Content Policy requires all users to abide by the following guidelines:\n\n1. Do not submit content that is illegal or violates the copyright of any work.\n\n2. Do not spam or submit unwanted solicitations.\n\n3. Do not submit content that incites hatred or violence against a person on the basis of their race, their ethnicity, their gender, their sexual orientation, or their disability.\n\n4. Do not submit content that causes immediate harm to others.\n\n5. Do not submit content containing another person\'s private information without their explicit permission or consent.\n\n6. Content must be tagged as NSFW when necessary.\n\n7. Do not submit content depicting a child (both real and virtual) engaged or involved in explicit sexual activities. A child is defined as a person who is under 18 years old; or a person, regardless of age, who is presented, depicted or portrayed as under 18 years old.\n\n8. Do not submit content depicting scat, extreme gore, snuff, or beastiality.\n\nContent that does not comply with this policy will be removed. Depending on the severity of the violation and the age of the account, the user will be banned temporarily or permanently.\n\nAn appeal may be made by contacting us via email: help@ani.social.\n\n### Privacy Policy\n\nThe Privacy Policy describes how AniSocial collects, uses, and shares your personal information.\n\n1. We collect the following types of information:\n\n- Information you provide us, which includes your username, email address, content, and any other information you choose to provide.\n\n- Information we collect automatically, which includes your IP address and browser information.\n\n2. We use your information for the following purposes:\n\n- For use of the instance, such as registering for an account, creating a submission, or sending you an email.\n\n- To improve the instance, which includes analyzing how you use the instance and identifying where we can improve.\n\n- To contact you about your account, the instance, or other necessary matters.\n\n3. We share your information with third-parties for the following purposes:\n\n- For the functionality of the instance, we use third party services such as Cloudflare (CDN) and Lark Suite (Email).\n\n- To comply with law enforcement, we will share information such as your email address, IP address, and submitted content.\n\nYou have the right to delete your information by going to the account settings tab and clicking the "Delete Account" button which will delete all your personal information residing on the server. We are not responsible for deleting information that is federated with other instances.\n\n### Bot Policy\n\nThe Bot Policy describes the rules regarding bots. Bots are defined as automated or scripted programs that interact with the instances using user accounts.\n\nThe Bot Policy requires users to abide by the following rules:\n\n1. Bots must be appropriately tagged as "Bot". This setting may be found under the user settings with the label "Bot Account".\n\n2. The owner of the bot is responsible for the actions and content produced and submitted by the bot.\n\n3. Bots must include the contact information of its owner in its profile description. The contact information must be any one of the following:\n\n- A valid email address\n- A valid Lemmy account that is federated with AniSocial\n\n4. Bots are subjected to the same content policy as indicated in the TOU.\n\nFailure to comply with this policy will result in a permanent ban of the bot account.\n\n### Federation Policy\n\nThe Federation Policy describes the conditions in which another instance may be defederated from AniSocial.\n\nAniSocial will only defederate from another instance if it meets any one of the following conditions:\n\n1. The instance creates technical or legal issues that affect AniSocial\'s functionality or compliance.\n2. The instance demonstrates a clear intention or purpose to cause harm to AniSocial.\n3. There is a relatively large amount of valid sitewide bans originating from that instance in AniSocial.\n4. There is credible evidence to suggest that a relatively large portion of an instance\'s userbase is deceptively using bots to pose as real users.\n5. The instance poses a reasonable risk to the development of Lemmy, the Fediverse, and/or ActivityPub as open decentralized social networking technologies.\n\n---\n\n_(Last updated: September 6, 2023)_',

As of right now, the main rules would be:\n\n**1. Don't do anything illegal** - anything against the law is basically prohibited here. We'd like to keep our instance relatively above board.\n\n**2. Stay on topic for the communities** - Stay on topic for the community you're posting in. Also respect their rules. The rules of which are left up to the mods of said community.\n\n**3. Be kind and respectful** - We want this to be a positive place, regardless of a person's ideals, values, and opinions. Just remember the person on the other side of the screen. Hate speech, name calling, or other rude/derogatory behavior is not generally allowed.\n\n**4. Please respect the rules of and do not harass others in remote or local communities** - The fediverse is a wide, wide place. There's multiple communities in existence that even predate our instance here dedicated to the subject of TTRPGs! Please don't go into other communities and disrespect their space. You can even subscribe and participate in those communities in addition to ours!\n\n**As of right now, we have no blanket rule on NSFW content. Due to the nature of TTRPGs depicting all sorts of sex, violence, drugs, and other adult themes, we don't plan on trying to limit this globally. This will be left up to the community in question to decide of NSFW posts/discussion/images fit in line with the community content and values.** We're willing to revisit this idea if there's an extreme desire by the community at large one way or the other, but for now, this is where we stand.\n\n**However, all NSFW posts are required to be tagged as such.**\n\n\n![](https://api.thegreenwebfoundation.org/greencheckimage/ttrpg.network?nocache=true)",

                "### Privacy Policy for lemdro.id (a Lemmy instance)\n\n#### Last Updated: 2023-08-11\n\n#### 1\\. Introduction\n\nWelcome to lemdro.id, a Lemmy instance. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy, retaining only the essential data for our instance's basic functionality. Our platform is open source, and all our code can be found transparently on [Github](https://github.com/lemdro-id).\n\n#### 2\\. Information We Collect\n\n**2.1. Account Information**: When registering on our Lemmy instance, we collect your username, encrypted password, and email address. This information is used solely for account-related notifications and password recovery.\n\n**2.2. Activity Data**: We document activities such as posts and comments. Due to the federation process, these can be shared with other Lemmy instances. Therefore, consider all posts as public and avoid sharing sensitive information.\n\n**2.3. Image Hosting**: Images uploaded to our Lemmy instance are hosted by Backblaze, a third-party service.\n\n#### 3\\. How We Use Your Information\n\nWe use your data for community interactions and content sharing across the Lemmy network. Your email address is used exclusively for account alerts and password recovery.\n\n#### 4\\. Data Preservation, Retention, and User Conduct\n\nWe retain user data as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. While we strive to maintain user data's integrity, we do not guarantee its indefinite preservation. We reserve the right to purge or delete user data from our database for any reason, especially involving violations of our instance rules, codes of conduct, or other community guidelines. Users should maintain personal backups of their critical and valuable information posted on lemdro.id.\n\n**4.1. Data Storage and Backups**: Our operation involves a rolling database backup system. Therefore, user account data, activities, and hosted images on Backblaze may remain in our main database or backup database temporarily after deletion. It may take some time before their complete removal.\n\n#### 5\\. Data Protection and Third-party Processors\n\nWe have implemented safeguards to protect your data against unauthorized access, intended to meet or exceed industry standards. Our Lemmy instance is hosted on fly.io; we use Cloudflare for security and performance optimization, and Backblaze for image hosting. Processing of your data by these third-party service providers is done according to their respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. If additional third-party processors are engaged in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.\n\n#### 6\\. Age Requirement\n\nTo comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU 2016/679), users must be at least 16 years old to use lemdro.id.\n\n#### 7\\. Your Rights and Choice\n\nUnder laws such as the *General Data Protection Regulation* (GDPR) in Europe, the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* (PIPEDA) in Canada, and the *California Consumer Privacy Act* (CCPA) in the United States, you have certain rights around your personal information. This includes the right to see your data, correct it if it's wrong, and in certain cases, have it completely erased. If you want to stop us from processing your data, you can do that anytime by [deleting your account](lemdro.id/settings). If you're worried about how your personal data is used, you can object to us processing your data, or you can file a complaint with the proper authority. To take advantage of your other rights or to lodge a complaint, you can reach out to us at support@lemdro.id.\n\n#### 8\\. Data Transfers\n\nGiven the nature of federation, data might be transferred to servers outside the European Economic Area (EEA). \n\n#### 9\\. DMCA Requests\n\nIf you believe that your rights under the DMCA are being infringed upon, send an email to dmca@lemdro.id detailing the following required information:\n\n- The name, address, and physical or electronic signature of the complaining party\n- Identification of the infringing materials and their internet location (e.g. a url)\n- Sufficient information to identify the copyrighted works\n- A statement by the copyright holder of a good faith belief that there is no legal basis for the use complained of\n- A statement of the accuracy of the notice and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the behalf of the copyright holder\n\nWe will review your request within 48 hours. If it is found to be valid, the infringing content will be taken down and the DMCA request forwarded to the original poster of the content.\n\n#### 10\\. Changes to This Policy\n\nWe may revise this policy periodically. We will communicate significant changes but also recommend that you review this policy regularly.\n\n#### 11\\. Contact Us\n\nFor inquiries or concerns, please reach out at support@lemdro.id.",

We will approve you as soon as possible after reviewing your response. If you don't answer the below question, your account won't be approved.\n\nThe Lemmy software doesn't seem to send emails on approval, so don't forget to check back and try logging in.\n\nWhere are you from?",

                '# Terms of use\n\nIf you use this website you consent to these terms of use. They may be updated without notice.\n\n## Cloudflare \n\nThis website may use Cloudflare functionality that is subject to it\'s own terms and conditions. For full information, see https://cloudflare.com.\n\nCloudflare collects usage data and may store an essential cookie for security reasons.\n\n## Federation\n\nThis website uses information federated from other Lemmy servers, and from other servers using the ActivityPub protocol (e.g. Mastodon), collectively "servers". We make a best effort attempt to protect personal information, however, the nature of federated servers requires that some content comes from other servers, and at times your browser or app may load information directly from those servers, which can have privacy implications.\n\nThe Lemmy software is not created by this website, and no guarantees can be made. All data entered into this website (including personal information) should be considered public. We strongly recommend you do not enter personal information into this website. \n\nIf you are not comfortable with user generated content coming from a large number of other servers who may have different content policies,  please do not use this website.\n\n## Private information\n\nLemmy.nz collects information that may be personally identifiable information. \n\nBasic account information: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture and header image. The username, display name, biography, profile picture and header image are always listed publicly, both on this website and on other websites where your public account details are federated to.\n\nContent: Your posts and comments are public in the community you post to. In some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, a request is sent to other servers to remove their copy but there is no guarantee this is honoured. The action of voting on a post may not be visible through the website, however, these are effectively public. Your public user details, posts, comments, direct mesages, votes, and other actions may be sent to other servers running ActivityPub compatible software that may publicly display this content, including your votes on posts and comments. \n\nYou grant us a licence to share your content (including images or other uploads) with other users, and other instances for the purposes of displaying to their users. You retain ownership of your content, and can remove your comments, posts, or account using website functionality. \n\nDirect mesages: Direct messages between users are not end-to-end encrypted, and may be sent to other servers that may display these in a different way. While normally these messages are only shown to the sending user and the receiving user, the message may be available to administrators of this website or other servers. If you need to send personal information or other sensitive information, you should use an end-to-end encrypted service such as Matrix.\n\nThis website is hosted in New Zealand, however, Cloudflare can see website activity and may use your data subject to their own [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) as an end user of their services.\n\nIf you choose to provide an email address, this may be sent to our email provider Mailgun in order to send you transactional emails (e.g. password reset).\n\nAs described above, content you provide to this website may be sent to other servers ("federated") so users of those servers can view the content you post. These servers may be located outside of New Zealand.\n\n## Acceptable use poilicy\n\nYou agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://lemmy.nz/post/63098). We may use our discretion to disable your access to the website or a website user account for any reason, and we have the final say on this matter.\n\n# Other content\n\nLemmy displays images and other content from other servers, which may cause the user to directly load this content. Content loaded from other servers may provide those servers with information including your IP address and browser user agent. The IP address can be used to identify your location, and the the user agent can contain information about your device, operating system, browser, and other technical information. IP addresses and user agents may also be stored in server logs both on this website and on other servers that your browser makes a connection to.\n\nA full list of other servers that this website shares information with (other than Cloudflare) can be found at https://lemmy.nz/instances. Note that due to the federated nature of Lemmy and ActivityPub, new servers can be added to this list at any time; for example, if a user of this website subscribes to a community on a new instance, or if a user on a new instance subscribes to a Lemmy.nz community.\n\n# Site usage by children\n\nIf this server is in the EU or the EEA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\nIf this server is in the USA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, per the requirements of COPPA (Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act) do not use this site.\n\n# Abuse\n\nThis website does not allow abuse of members, and we make a good faith effort to remove content that does not align with our [Code of Conduct](https://lemmy.nz/post/63098). This includes removing content that has come from other servers. The website contains functionality for users to report content, including content retrieved from other servers. Reports may go to moderators and administrators of this website, the website of the user that is being reported, and the website of the community that the content resides in. Reports may also be shared via other channels (e.g. Matrix) in order to coordinate spam and abuse removal across different servers.\n\nIf you feel a report has not been satisfactorily resolved, please direct message [@Dave@lemmy.nz](https://lemmy.nz/u/Dave). Alternatively you can message using Matrix at @bechorin:matrix.org, or post in the [public Matrix chat room](https://lemmy.nz/post/169187) where more administrators and moderators can see the request.\n\n## Cookies\n\nCookies are pieces of information the website stores in your browser. Cookies are  used for remembering that you are logged in, by storing a token that is associated with your account. Cloudflare may also use a cookie, used for detecting abuse and collecting usage information.',

                "**Læs venligst følgende grundigt.**\n\nTak fordi du gerne vil oprette dig hos Feddit.dk 🙂. Feddit.dk stræber efter at være et non-profit, imødekommende forum for alle dansksprogede på nettet. For at undgå spam og for at sikre at nye brugere er indforstået med de regler og principper der ligger til grund for kommunikationen her på siden, skal nye brugere ansøge for at oprette sig ved at følge disse to trin:\n\n1. [Læs reglerne](https://feddit.dk/post/262851). Du kan finde dem i sidebaren på [forsiden](https://feddit.dk) eller du kan [følge dette link](https://feddit.dk/post/262851).\n2. Beskriv med et par sætninger hvordan du tolker regel 1 og hvordan du vil sikre at du følger den regel. **Skriv dit svar i tekstboksen nedenfor**.\n\nDin bruger vil blive nævnt i en kommentar i [denne tråd](https://feddit.dk/post/262859) når du er godkendt. Hvis din ansøgning bliver afvist vil vi kontakte dig via din email (emailen er ellers ikke nødvendig). Du kan også selv [kontakte administrationen på denne mail ffrfjacje@mozmail.com](mailto:ffrfjacje@mozmail.com) for at stille spørgsmål.\n\n# Hvorfor kræves der en ansøgning?\nSociale medier ejet af firmaer (såsom Facebook, Twitter eller Reddit) har en interesse i at forøge antallet af deres brugere, da det giver dem mulighed for at tjene flere penge gennem reklamer. Derfor gør de det nemt for folk at oprette sig. Desværre betyder det også, at der er meget spam og dårlig opførsel på disse platforme.\n\nHos Feddit.dk er der ingen reklamer, og vi tjener ikke penge på, at der kommer flere brugere. **Derfor prioriterer Feddit.dk en høj *kvalitet* af brugere, fremfor en høj *kvantitet*.** Håbet er, at dette fører til et mere imødekommende miljø og en bedre oplevelse for alle på Feddit.dk.",

Ligeledes indsamles der kun de oplysninger du selv skriver når du skriver indlæg eller kommentarer på siden.\n\n## Hvor lagres mine oplysninger?\nFeddit.dk kører lige nu på en server i Tyskland. Privat data omkring din bruger (fx din email, adgangskode og private beskeder til andre brugere af Feddit.dk) forlader ikke denne server og bliver dermed inden for EU.\n\nDog skal du huske at Feddit.dk er med i fediverset. Offentlige oplysninger som dit brugernavn, dit profilbillede, dine indlæg, dine kommentarer og faktisk også dine stemmer på indlæg og kommentarer sendes til andre serverer i fediverset (som kan være arbitrære steder i verden). Dette burde ikke være et problem - det er jo trods alt offentligt alligevel og enhver kan se de oplysninger allerede ved blot at besøge Feddit.dk. Private beskeder til brugere på andre servere i fediverset sendes naturligvis også til den server så den bruger kan modtage din besked (præcis ligesom med email). Du samtykker til at disse oplysninger sendes til de andre servere i fediverset når du opretter en bruger hos Feddit.dk.\n\nOplysningerne lagres så længe du har en bruger på Feddit.dk.\n\n## Hvordan behandles mine oplysninger?\nDine oplysninger bliver kun brugt til at facilitere din egen brug af Feddit.dk. Oplysningerne bliver ikke solgt eller på anden måde delt med tredjeparter, udover oplysninger der deles på tværs af servere i fediverset som beskrevet ovenfor.\n\n## Du har ret til at bede om din data eller slette din data\nDu kan bede om alt data omkring din bruger ved at kontakte en administrator. Du kan selv slette din bruger, hvilket også vil slette alle dine indlæg og kommentarer.\n\nHvis du har spørgsmål eller klager, så kontakt en administrator eller evt. klag til Datatilsynet.",

                "**Privacy Policy**\n\nWe provide this information according to the EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) for those who consult the website https://monero.town and request to register. Note that this information applies only to that website and not to other websites the user may consult through links.\n\n**Data controller**\n\nThe data controller is [@admin@monero.town](https://monero.town/u/admin). \n\n**What data is collected.**\n\nRegarding this point, we must distinguish two steps.\n\n(a) Registration in the community: username, password;\n\n(b) Access to the community and user activities: IP address, username, password.\n\nThe user data (username, password) are recorded in the database, and specifically, the passwords are “hashed” (i.e., transformed into alphanumeric strings using the hash function).\n\n**Access to the community and user activities**\n\nHaving completed the account creation process, the user can log in (Login) to the community through the browser, the IP address is acquired.\n\nEach user is responsible for the content they intend to post on the Lemmy community.\n\nIn that phase, the personal data of users collected are the username, password and IP address.\n\n**Who can access the data and for what activities.**\n\nThe server administrator (instance) can read data of the activities performed on the community recorded on the server and precisely in the database or log files (username, IP address, community web address, type of activity - technically GET or POST).\n\nThe administrator only accesses users’ personal data for strictly technical reasons.\n\nWe should point out that access to users’ personal data, whether in the database or logs, is a specific activity that is not generally performed except to resolve particular conflicts or errors.\n\n**The purposes of the processing.**\n\nThe purpose is to consult this website or interact by posting content, comments, or creating other communities. Accessing this website, and requesting to register as a user, means the user gave consent.\n\nFurthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and application upgrades.\n\nThe optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site involves the acquisition of the sender’s address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained in the message. These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly necessary for the purposes related to data processing.\n\n**Legal basis for the processing**\n\nThe processing of personal data is based on consent - according to article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user by browsing this website and its consultation, thus accepting this information.\n\nConsent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by email to monerobull@protonmail.com, specifying that, in this case, whether the user does not consent, they cannot consult this website, either register or remain as a registered user.\n\nRegarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n\n**Cookies**\n\nThe only cookies are only functional ones and, therefore, no profiling or tracking activities.\n\nThus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require the user’s consent.\n\n**Data recipients**\n\nWe do not communicate personal data collected from this website following its consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.\n\n**Period for storing personal data**\n\nApart from what is specified above, the data collected by this website during its operation are stored for the time strictly necessary for the activities specified. The data will be deleted or anonymized at the expiry date unless there are no other purposes for storing the same.\n\n**Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization**\n\nThe data controller, the administrator of Lemmy’s instance, does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if Lemmy is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.\n\nWe feel it is appropriate to clarify this further.\n\nUsers registered on an instance are always solely responsible for their activities by creating communities or publishing posts or comments.\n\nThere is no transfer outside the SEE when registered users on an instance within the same EEA perform activities on the same server (instance). For example, our instance (https://monero.town) is located in Lithuania and thus within the EEA. If users registered on our instance perform activities on our server, there is no data transfer outside the EEA. Similarly, there is no data transfer outside the EEA even if registered users on our instance subscribe, publish posts, or comments on other instances - for example - located outside the EEA. Indeed, in the latter case, our instance administrator can access the logs and see only the domain (and thus not even the full URL of the community on which activities are performed) and its IP address. No further user data is transferred outside the EEA by the administrator or automatically by the Lemmy platform. The user should be aware that their username in the form “@username@domainofcommunity” (e.g., in our case, @username@monero.town) will be visible in the community in which they have intervened (e.g., to publish posts or comments).\n\nThere will be no transfer of data outside the EEA even if the user intends to create a community on the existing Lemmy instance within the same EEA.\n\nAll of this is because it is a proper function of the fediverse’s system and the ActivityPub protocol used by Lemmy.\n\n**Security measures**\n\nVisitors’ or users’ data are processed lawfully and correctly by adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of data. Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation protocol, encrypting the information.\n\n**Data subjects’ rights**\n\nUsers (data subject) of this website may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679. You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to monerobull@protonmail.com\n\n**Right to lodge a complaint**\n\nWhether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them as performed via this website infringes the Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the Garante according to Article 77 of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n",

              legal_information:
                "PRIVACY POLICY\n\nYiffit.net is a service that allows you to send and receive social content such as text posts, links, images, comments, direct messages etc. as well as sending and receiving social interactions such as upvotes, downvotes, bookmarks, etc. to and from users across the internet.\n\nYiffit.net's software, known as Lemmy, works by creating for each of its users both an inbox and outbox with which they can receive and send social content over the internet. \n\nUsers can receive content from both other Yiffit.net users and communities (local) as well as users and communities from across the internet (remote). Content from this inbox is then displayed in form of a \"feed\" or \"timeline\", representing a list of content such as posts and comments which the user has subscribed to or might find interesting.\n\nWhen creating new content or performing an action that interacts with existing content or users, Yiffit.net's server will place this interaction in the user's outbox and immediately deliver it on the user's behalf to all known (by the Yiffit.net server) users and communities across the internet as part of the process of communicating these social interactions and being able to offer a social network experience.\n\nWhen a remote user, community or server requests information about social content hosted on Yiffit.net (for example, when trying to access the user's profile), Yiffit.net will also send on behalf of the user a list of social interactions that are part of the user's public profile.\n\nIn summary: in order to be able to provide a social network experience with users who are not members of Yiffit.net, the user authorizes Yiffit.net to request content and send content on the user's behalf to and from other users, communities and servers across the internet. Yiffit.net acts thus as a messaging system to receive and send social content and interactions to and from across the internet and then display them on screen in a coherent way that allows the user to read the content and interact with it.\n\nSending and receiving social content and interactions to and from other users on the internet is similar to email. Yiffit.net does not control, own or have access to the inbox of remote users, communities and servers. \n\n**By using the website Yiffit.net the user understands and accepts that the content of any interaction such as messages, posts, upvotes, downvotes, bookmarks, etc... is immediately sent and delivered across the internet.** As such, the user understands and accepts that any content and interaction is inherently public and that it is not possible to guarantee the removal or deletion of any copies of such interactions that were delivered to remote users, communities and servers across the internet.\n\n**Yiffit.net never shares or sends personal identifiable information such as IP addresses, email addresses or browsing meta-data.** Yiffit.net will only send on behalf of the user interactions that they have performed on the site as well as public details that make up the user's social profile such as username, profile description, profile photo, profile banner, etc.\n\nSince the nature of the social interactions on Yiffit.net is public, we recommend users to choose a username that will not publicly identify them unless they willingly decide to do so and understand that any interactions on the site may be public, as well as the fact that Yiffit.net has no ability to control or remove data from the inbox of remote servers after such an interaction has been sent out. We can only request that remote servers delete or hide content that has already been received by them, but we have no ability to enforce its removal.\n\nIt is worth noting that \"direct messages\" to other users are only sent to the server where the other user has their inbox. If the recipient of a direct message is a Yiffit.net user, then that message will NOT be broadcast or sent across the internet. When direct messages are sent to non-yiffit.net users, then they are sent in an encrypted and secure manner with the use of TLS certificates. However, it's worth noting that once they have arrived at their destination, direct messages are not stored in an encrypted manner in the database and that any person managing the server where the remote inbox is located could potentially have access to their message. So called Direct Messages are an exception to most if not all other social interactions on Yiffit.net which are almost always public in nature, and even Direct Messages shoud not be used to convey critically sensitive information due to the risk of being read by malicious remote server administrators.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Yiffit.net will not send out images to remote servers. Images are hosted by Yiffit.net and will have to be requested to our server for them to be displayed to remote users. However, we do not have the ability to guarantee that remote servers or users will not cache them or save a copy.\n\n**The user accepts and agrees not to hold Yiffit.net, its administrators, moderators and users liable for any damages, negative consequences, impact to their reputation, financial losses, etc. that derive from Yiffit.net fulfilling its role and task as a service to receive, deliver and publicly broadcast the social content and interactions that the user does when using the social platform offered by Yiffit.net**\n\nThe user also understands and accepts that due to the way the software Yiffit.net uses works (lemmy), that currently any messages the user deletes are still visible by administrators and community moderators (only the community they were sent in), whether local or remote. We do not like this behavior for deleted messages and will work in the following months to implement features that allow users to delete messages and broadcast a request to other servers to also delete this content, not just hide it from users.\n\nCurrently we recommend our users to edit their message before deleting them. Lemmy does not keep version history and this should ensure that content is removed by replacing it with any other arbitrary content (or leaving it blank) as long as remote servers accept the user's request to alter the content, to hide it from users, to not keep a version history or to delete it from its database. Yiffit.net can not guarantee that remote users, communities or servers will comply with such requests and we recommend our users treat everything they write or do on this platform as irreversibly public. Please consider our recommendation to use an alias as a username to protect your privacy.\n\nYiffit.net is a non-commercial personal project. By using Yiffit.net the user accepts and understands that there are no guarantees of availability and that the administrator of Yiffit.net may not be held liable for any negative consequences suffered if the site stops working, were to disappear completely, any loss of data and/or bugs in the software that Yiffit.net uses to provide this voluntary and private service. That said, we will do our best to keep the uptime as high as possible. In the case of permanent service closure we aim to announce it with at least 3 months of anticipation.\n\nWe are committed to the utmost care in regards to personal identifying information, ensuring that we never share or disclose such information to unauthorized third parties. Please find below a list of persons or companies who are authorized to hold, transfer or work with your data in order to be able to make Yiffit.net work.\n\nOther relevant information:\n\n- Yiffit.net is hosted on a dedicated server in Germany. Backups are also hosted in Germany.\n- Only @Wander@yiffit.net has access to the server and the data that it contains.\n- Mailjet.com is our email delivery provider and they have access to your email and other information contained within those emails in order to be able to send you emails.\n- Cloudflare R2 is our object storage provider. We are using their 'western europe' endpoint.\n- Cloudflare is also used to protect our server from DDoS attacks and technically could see data in transit.\n- Site admins and moderators cannot access your email address or IP address.\n- IP logs are retained for 14 days for moderation purposes only (ie. detect and prevent abuse by malicious actors registering multiple accounts)",

Blogs are fine as long as they have original content or add significant content to news or issue. \n* This is a community Lemmy instance so be respectful of other users.\n* No trolling and no shitposting. Low quality posts and comments will be removed without warning. Repeat offenders will be banned.\n* Prefer reporting bugs to https://bugs.kde.org, as KDE developers do not scan lemmy for bug reports.\n* Avoid comparing various desktop environments, distros, and/or other FLOSS projects. This instance is for discussing the KDE community and the software it produces, and not about pointless flamewars between open source projects.\n* In case of doubt, consult KDE's [Code of conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/). Violations of the CoC will result in banning.\n---\n\n**KDE** is a commmunity creating free and open source software for desktop and portable computing.  \n\n---\n\n**KDE Websites**\n\n* [KDE Homepage](https://kde.org)\n* [KDE News](https://dot.kde.org)\n* [KDE Blogs](https://planetkde.org)\n* [KDE Discuss (Forum/Discourse)](https://discuss.kde.org/)\n* [KDE Wikis](https://wiki.kde.org/)\n* [KDE Bug tracker and reporter](https://bugs.kde.org/)\n\n---\n\n**Donate to KDE**\n\n* [Become an official Supporting Member](https://kde.org/fundraisers/plasma6member/)\n\n* [Help fund KDE projects with a one-off donation](https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2022/)\n\n---\n\n**Want to contribute to KDE?**\n\nFor starters:\n\n* The best way to start contributing is to contact the community over [Matrix](https://community.kde.org/Matrix) and [IRC](https://userbase.kde.org/IRC_Channels)\n\n* At first sight, it might seem a bit hard to interact in those groups. That's okay! Join them first, see how things are done, mention your interest and where you'd like to work with. We may even find a [mentor](https://community.kde.org/Mentoring) for you!\n\n* The KDE Community develops and distributes open source software. As such, we follow a sort of do-ocracy wherein tasks are done and assigned by contributors themselves. Feel free to pick an area and just start contributing immediately! We're always here to help you along the way. A good way to contribute with code for the first time is to fix an unfixed bug that afflicts you or [assign yourself to junior jobs](https://community.kde.org/KDE/Junior_Jobs) and start working on them.\n\n* It's always nice to collaborate optimally with others in any given setting, but this is especially important for community projects like those following the open source model, so remember to read the [KDE Code of Conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\nHere are a few links to help you in your first contributions to KDE:\n\n* [Get Involved](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved)\n\n* [Your first commit](https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab)\n\n* [Write code](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development)\n\n* [Report issues](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/Issue_Reporting)\n\n* [Triage bug reports](https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Bug_triaging)\n\n* [Translate software and documentation](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/translation)\n\n* [Design applications and icons](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/design)\n\n* [Write documentation](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/documentation)\n\n* [Manage websites and backends](https://community.kde.org/KDE.org)\n\n* [Support other users](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/support)\n\n* [Promote KDE](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/promotion)\n\n* [Make KDE software more accessible](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/accessibility)\n\n* [Assist with management and organization](https://community.kde.org/Gardening)\n\n* [Update the wikis](https://userbase.kde.org/Tasks_and_Tools)\n\n---\n\nGet started learning QML:\n\n* [The new KDE intro to QML](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/widget/qml/)\n\n* [The original Plasma Developer Guide](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/DeveloperGuide)\n\n* [Test QML code live](https://qmlonline.kde.org/)\n\n* [Comprehensive community book on QML](https://qmlbook.github.io/)\n\n* [The official KDAB YouTube course on QML](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6CJYn40gN6hdNC1IGQZfVI707dh9DPRc)\n\n* [The official Qt documentation on QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-tutorial.html)\n\n---\n\nGet started learning C++:\n\n* [The new KDE intro to C++](https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/hello_world/)\n\n* [An app to more easily create apps with a template, KAppTemplate](https://userbase.kde.org/KAppTemplate)\n\n* [The free edX course by New York University](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-programming-in-c)\n\n* [The freemium Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus)\n\n* [Comprehensive wikibook for C++](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming)\n\n* [The Wikiversity C++ course](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)\n\n* [The LearnCPP tutorial website](https://www.learncpp.com/)\n\n* [The CPlusPlus tutorial website](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)\n\n---\nKDE logo copyright KDE e.V. and Oxygen Icons under the [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt)",

No real content is stored here (other than issues on the official community) but you can create an account then access other federated servers so that you reduce their traffic and help not overload them. This helps keep other Lemmy instances fast and working. If they go down you can still access other Lemmy communities. Or just have a backup account (good practice). \n\nServer is reliable and easily run and maintained by keeping everything as simple/cheap as possible wherever I can. Downtime is expected to be minimal due to the design, however there are no bells or whistles. This is a cheap to run instance, and I wont let costs run away.\n\nBlocked instances are any instances that host illegal content I am notified about or spam/troll etc. and is pulled from FediNuke.txt that many instances use to block hostile servers. Nothing more, just don't want a hard time. Don't get onto that list. I don't maintain it, I just use it.\nRules are don't be an idiot and make our lives hard basically or troll/be racist/do illegal stuff. I just want things to be simple. \n\nIf any content is found that is questionable or illegal or any of the usual stuff just report it and it can be deleted. If any admin from another instance needs me to ban any user or bot account just contact me. Happy to remove fake or evil accounts. I like to keep things simple as I said. No drama = everyone is happy.\n\nAny problems just create a support thread or message user ‘Thief’ for help. \nIf you cant create a thread email me at: admin at myserv dot one",

Accessing this website, and requesting to register as a user, means the user gave consent.\n\nFurthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and application upgrades.\n\nThe optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site involves the acquisition of the sender’s address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained in the message. These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly necessary for the purposes related to data processing.\n\n## Legal basis for the processing\n\nThe processing of personal data is based on consent - according to article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user by browsing this website and its consultation, thus accepting this information.\n\nConsent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by email to admin@dormizone.com, specifying that, in this case, whether the user does not consent, they cannot consult this website, either register or remain as a registered user.\n\nRegarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n\n## Cookies\n\nThe only cookies are only functional ones and, therefore, no profiling or tracking activities.\n\n**Thus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require the user’s consent.**\n\n## Data recipients\n\nWe do not communicate personal data collected from this website following its consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.\n\n## Period for storing personal data\n\nApart from what is specified above, the data collected by this website during its operation are stored for the time strictly necessary for the activities specified. The data will be deleted or anonymized at the expiry date unless there are no other purposes for storing the same.\n\n## Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization\n\nThe data controller, the administrator of Lemmy’s instance, does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if Lemmy is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.\n\nWe feel it is appropriate to clarify this further.\n\nUsers registered on an instance are always solely responsible for their activities by creating communities or publishing posts or comments.\n\nThere is no transfer outside the SEE when registered users on an instance within the same EEA perform activities on the same server (instance). For example, our instance (https://dormi.zone) is located in Germany and thus within the EEA. If users registered on our instance perform activities on our server, there is no data transfer outside the EEA. Similarly, there is no data transfer outside the EEA even if registered users on our instance subscribe, publish posts, or comments on other instances - for example - located outside the EEA. Indeed, in the latter case, our instance administrator can access the logs and see only the domain (and thus not even the full URL of the community on which activities are performed) and its IP address. No further user data is transferred outside the EEA by the administrator or automatically by the Lemmy platform. The user should be aware that their username in the form “@username@domainofcommunity” (e.g., in our case, @username@dormi.zone) will be visible in the community in which they have intervened (e.g., to publish posts or comments).\n\nThere will be no transfer of data outside the EEA even if the user intends to create a community on the existing Lemmy instance within the same EEA.\n\nAll of this is because it is a proper function of the fediverse’s system and the ActivityPub protocol used by Lemmy.\n\n## Security measures\n\nVisitors’ or users’ data are processed lawfully and correctly by adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of data. Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation protocol, encrypting the information.\n\n## Data subjects’ rights\n\nUsers (data subject) of this website may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679. You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to admin@dormizone.com.\n\n## Right to lodge a complaint\n\nWhether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them as performed via this website infringes the Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the Garante according to Article 77 of the EU Regulation 2016/679.",

                "Please read this document carefully before accessing or using this service!\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 English, Not Legalese\n\nMost Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.\n\nWe decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible. Some sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time.\n\nWhen you read 'the hackliberty.org homeserver' or 'the Service' below, it refers to the services made available at **hackliberty.org** which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.\n\nWhere you read *Hack Liberty*, or *we *or* us* below, it refers to the Hack Liberty organization we created in June 2022 to run the hackliberty.org homeserver. **This agreement does not apply to Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like the Web and this agreement only applies to the server (hackliberty.org) provided by Hack Liberty**\n\nIf this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else!\n\nContact Information:\n\nEmail: [contact@hackliberty.org](mailto:contact@hackliberty.org)\n\nShould you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an email at [contact@hackliberty.org](mailto:contact@hackliberty.org).\n\n### 1.2 Using The Service Means Accepting These Terms\n\nBy accessing or using the Service in any way, whether you have created a Matrix account on the hackliberty.org homeserver, or whether you are accessing content federated from the hackliberty.org homeserver to another Matrix homeserver, or are just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.\n\nIf you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else and refrain from accessing content federated from this server.\n\n### 1.3 This Is a Living Document\n\nThis is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.\n\nIf you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We're all ears! Email contact@hackliberty.org and we'll chat.\n\nWe don't amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your proposed changes apply to all of our users, we'll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.\n\nWe will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.\n\nYour access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.\n\n### 1.4 Breach of Terms\n\nIf you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Service automatically terminates.\n\nWe may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.\n\nIf you think we removed your access by mistake, send an email to [contact@hackliberty.org](mailto:contact@hackliberty.org) and we'll give you our reasoning.\n\n## 2. Support\n\nSupport for the hackliberty.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by Hack Liberty - however, support is often available from the wider Matrix Community in the public Matrix Support rooms.\n\nQueries sent to [contact@hackliberty.org](mailto:contact@hackliberty.org) will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the unpaid team. Phone support is not provided.\n\nWe love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a very small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we'll try our best, we do not provide 24/7 support.\n\n## 3. Intellectual Property Rights\n\n*Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.*\n\n### 3.1 Who Owns the IP of My Messages and Files?\n\nWe do not claim intellectual property rights over rooms, message content or files uploaded to the Service.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that we have no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your messages or files modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute them, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.\n\nWe may pre-screen user messages or files to prevent spam and other abuse, and we may remove any messages or files (including entire rooms) from the hackliberty.org homeserver for any reason without notice at our sole discretion. By posting or uploading your messages or files, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the rights necessary for you to post or upload said messages or files.\n\nYou are solely and entirely responsible for all of your messages and files that you post or otherwise submit via the Service. You shall assume all risks associated with the use of said content including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness. Hack Liberty does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your messages or files.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using the Service, you may be exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.\n\n## 4. Reliability\n\n### 4.1 Do You Guarantee That The Service Will Be Accessible at All Times?\n\nIn short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability of the Service and your data.\n\nWe monitor the Service closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email, push notifications and phone calls) when the hackliberty.org homeserver is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Hack Liberty, shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on the hackliberty.org homeserver at any time.\n\n## 5. App Developers\n\nWe encourage you to write software that uses the Matrix Protocol and interfaces with the Service!\n\nThe Matrix Protocol and our implementation will change over time, and we may change or deprecate APIs or behaviour for any feature of the Service from time to time - it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to or via our Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the Service. We will always try to inform you of any changes with reasonable notice so you can adjust your Application, but we are under no obligation to do so.\n\nProvided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement and our policies and procedures, you may use the Service to execute Applications owned by you. You are solely responsible for your Applications, including any data, text, images or content they contain.\n\n## 6. Play Nice Clauses\n\n*Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.*\n\n### 6.1 Use of The Service\n\nYou agree that you shall not:\n\n* Use or attempt to gain unauthorised access to or use another's account, password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to the hackliberty.org homeserver, whether through malicious attacks, password mining or any other means.\n\n* Access or attempt to access any material that you are not authorized to access.\n\n* Disrupt or interfere with the security of, or otherwise cause harm to, the hackliberty.org homeserver, systems resources, accounts, passwords, servers or networks connected to or accessible through the Service or any affiliated or linked sites.\n\n* Use the Service to transmit unsolicited or bulk communications to anyone at all, be they users of the Service, federated Matrix homeservers, or connected on a bridged network.\n\n* Post or otherwise submit any software, programs or files in a manner that is intended to cause harm or disruption of another's equipment, software or other property, including any corrupted files, time bombs, Trojan horses, viruses and worms.\n\n* Disrupt, interfere or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Service.\n\n* Access or use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair any server we run or the network(s) connected to the Service.\n\n* Violate any applicable laws or regulations related to the access to or use of the Service, or engage in any activity prohibited by the Terms of Use.\n\n* Use the Service for any unlawful purposes or in support of illegal activities under Icelandic law. By using the Service, you agree to comply with all applicable laws governing your online conduct and content\n\n* Act in a way that is in violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://git.hackliberty.org/hackliberty.org/hackliberty.org-legal/src/branch/main/code-of-conduct.md) in rooms that are part of the Matrix community ([#hackliberty.org:hackliberty.org](https://matrix.to/#/#hackliberty.org:hackliberty.org)).\n\n* Violate the rights of Hack Liberty or any third party (including rights of privacy and publicity) or abuse, defame, harass, stalk or threaten another.\n\nMaterials and Services provided by third parties are governed by separate agreements accompanying such materials and services. Hack Liberty offers no guarantees and assumes no responsibility or liability of any type with respect to the third-party services, including any liability resulting from incompatibility between a third-party service, the hackliberty.org service or another third-party service. You agree that you will not hold Hack Liberty responsible or liable with respect to the third-party services.\n\n### 6.2 Illegal Content\n\nAny content containing or promoting indecent images/depictions of children is illegal and utterly prohibited on the Service. When we become aware of such content, we refer the details to the relevant authorities. If you've found an account, room or group being used for the distribution or promotion of child sexual exploitation, please share the details in an email to [abuse@hackliberty.org](mailto:abuse@hackliberty.org).\n\n## 7. Restriction and Termination of Use\n\nWe may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.\n\n## 8. Encryption\n\nThe Services may allow you to encrypt your communications end-to-end between devices. There may be restrictions and limitations on the import, possession, use, transfer and/or export of strong encryption technology under the laws of the country in which you intend to use the Service. It is your sole obligation and responsibility to check such restrictions and limitations before using the Service and to comply with them. We reserve the right to suspend the Service immediately and without notice if we determine, in our sole judgment, that the Service is being used in violation of local regulations governing the use of cryptographic technologies (even though we have no responsibility to make such determination).\n\n## 9. Links to Third Party Sites\n\nThe Service may include links that will take you to other sites outside of the Service. The linked sites are provided as a convenience and the inclusion of the links do not imply any endorsement by us of any linked site. We have no control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site, any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site. You further acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any form of transmission (e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.\n\n## 10. Warranties and Disclaimers\n\nThe hackliberty.org service is provided by Hack Liberty under these terms of use \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, Hack Liberty makes no warranty that:\n\n1. the Service will meet your requirements;\n\n2. the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;\n\n3. the quality of the Service will meet your expectations; and\n\n4. any errors or defects in the Service will be corrected.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that:\n\n1.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Hack Liberty, will have no liability related to user materials arising under intellectual property rights, libel, privacy, publicity, obscenity or other laws. Hack Liberty also disclaims all liability with respect to the misuse, loss, modification or unavailability of any user messages or files.\n\nThe use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk and with your agreement that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system, loss of data or other harm that results from such activities. Hack Liberty assumes no liability for any computer virus or other similar software code that is downloaded to your computer from the site or in connection with any services or materials. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Hack Liberty or via the site, services or materials shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms of use. Hack Liberty will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account with respect to the site or any services or materials, either with or without your knowledge.\n\nSome states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To the extent permissible, any implied warranties are limited to ninety days.\n\n## 11. Indemnity and Liability\n\n*Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.*\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Hack Liberty and its officers, co-branders, other partners and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of:\n\n1. your user materials and any other content (e.g. computer viruses) that you may submit, post to or transmit through the Service, including a third party's use of such user materials or content (e.g. reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your user materials);\n\n2. your access to or use of the Service (including any use by your employees, contractors or agents and all uses of your usernames and passwords, whether or not actually or expressly authorized by you, in connection with the Service);\n\n3. your connection to the Service;\n\n4. your violation of the Terms of Use;\n\n5. your infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights when using any of the software made available on the Service;\n\n6. your violation of any rights of any third party;\n\n7. your access to or use of linked sites and your connections thereto; or\n\n8. any dealings between you and any third parties advertising or promoting via the Service.\n\n## 12. Emergency Service Calls\n\nThe Service does not and is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services (e.g. E911 or 112 numbers). We are not liable for any claims, damages or loss which arise from this limitation.\n\n## 13. Limitation of Liability\n\n*Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.*\n\nIn no event shall Hack Liberty, its officers, directors, employees, partners or suppliers be liable to you or any third party for any special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages or losses of any kind, or any damages or losses whatsoever, including those resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether or not foreseeable or if Hack Liberty has been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses, and on any theory of liability, including breach of contract or warranty, negligence or other tortious action, or any other claim arising out of or in connection with:\n\n1. the access or use of or the inability to access or use the Service;\n\n2. the statements or actions of any third party on or via the site, services or materials;\n\n3. any dealings with vendors or other third parties;\n\n4. any unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions, user materials or other data;\n\n5. any information that is sent or received or not sent or received;\n\n6. any failure to store or loss of data, files, materials or other content;\n\n7. any services available that are delayed or interrupted;\n\n8. any web site referenced or linked to from this site; or\n\n9. your access to or use of or inability to access or use any linked site.\n\nSome jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages. Accordingly, the limitations and exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.\n\n## 14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Iceland, excluding its conflict of law provisions. Unless contrary to the law where you reside, all disputes relating to this Agreement are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Iceland and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of Iceland in connection with any such dispute. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\n\n## 15. General\n\nThe Service is licensed, not sold, to you by Hack Liberty for use strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Ownership of the Service shall at all times remain with Hack Liberty. Access to the Service is provided to you only to allow you to exercise your rights under this Agreement.\n\n### 15.1 Grant of License\n\nSubject to your acceptance of, and compliance with, this Agreement and any payment requirements for the Service (if applicable), Hack Liberty hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable licence, in and under our intellectual property rights, to access and use the Services, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features provided by us that augment or enhance the current Service shall also constitute \"Service\" and shall be subject to these terms and conditions. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are retained by Hack Liberty.\n\nYou may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Hack Liberty services, third party content or third party software. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by Hack Liberty to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.\n\n## 16. Document History\n\n* 2022, June 1: Document created\n\n---\n\n**A note to other startups:** this document was heavily inspired by [Balsamiq's plain English ToS document](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/). We were impressed by their championing of plain English, and wanted to reproduce that as much as possible in our own legal documentation. Feel free to draw similar inspiration from this document, though be sure to get any documents you produce checked over by a lawyer. Good luck!\n\n---\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Hack Liberty community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.\n\nThis applies to conversation in the any room in the Hack Liberty matrix community ([#hackliberty.org:hackliberty.org](https://matrix.to/#/#hackliberty.org:hackliberty.org)) and commits and comments relating to any project in the [hackliberty.org](https://git.hackliberty.org) gitea space.\n\n## **Community Rules**\n- <mark>**Don’t do to others what you don’t want done to you**</mark>\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for revealing personal information about yourself or others\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for incitement of violence or self harm\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for porn, gore, lewd, violent, or NSFW content\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for unsoliciated advertising or spam\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for posting URLs to shock sites, information grabbers, or malware\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for any harassment as defined below\n- <mark>**INSTANT BAN**</mark> for global @room pings or gratuitous direct pinging\n- <mark>**WARNING**</mark> OR <mark>**BAN**</mark> for disruptive behavior such as; spam, flooding the chat, offtopic discussions, or unnecessary drama\n- <mark>**WARNING**</mark> and <mark>**DELETE**</mark> for any URLs containing link shorteners\n- <mark>**WARNING**</mark> or <mark>**BAN**</mark> for trolling, bullying or stalking\n\n## **Community Guidelines**\n\n-  **Stay on topic in rooms**\n-  **Be friendly and patient**\n-  **Treat each other with dignity and respect**\n-  **Agree to disagree if a discussion is no longer productive**\n- **Foster an environment of information sharing and collaboration**\n\n## Definitions\n\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Incitement of violence, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm\n- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological\n- Offensive comments related to sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, race or religious affiliation\n- Deliberate intimidation\n- Stalking or following\n- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes\n- Sustained disruption of discussion\n- Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour\n- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease\n- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse\n- Publication of non-harassing private communication\n\n## **Moderation**\n- Chat room moderators volunteer their time to help keep the room running smoothly and are responsible for managing often complex situations\n\n- Moderators are given exclusive privileges to help maximise the effectiveness of the room\n\n- If you are asked to modify your behaviour or given some other form of instruction but fail to comply, you are likely to be removed from the chat room for a discretionary period of time depending on the severity of the matter\n\n- When being corrected by a moderator, please do not argue with them in main chat. You should request a PM session to help avoid conflict and keep the involvement of others to a minimum\n\n- Attacking moderators in the chat room will likely result in a ban. Any genuine visitor should respect their decisions - they have nothing to gain from issuing bans / mutes and are doing so to the best of their ability, on behalf of the community\n\n- Moderators may choose to request users to leave if they're deemed to be a risk to the safety of the general users / guests within the chatroom. Not adhering to the request will result in manual removal\n\n- An appeal can be requested but is to the discretion of the moderator who issued that ban / mute - however, this is not a given right. To make an appeal, please PM the respective moderator\n\n- You are welcome to return to the chat room once your ban period expires, but please be mindful of the reason(s) you got banned, abide by the rules and take into account any moderator feedback received.\n\n- If a ban is evaded within the designated period (for any reason), please note that our moderators may extend the ban beyond the original lapse date.\n\n### Reporting Issues\n\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report in Matrix or by contacting us via abuse@hackliberty.org. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:\n\n- Your contact information.\n- Names (usernames and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.\n- The date and time of the incident (or start of incident).\n- Any additional information that may be helpful.\n\nAfter filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\n### Attribution & Acknowledgements\n\nThis Code of Conduct is based on the [TODO Group](https://twitter.com/todogroup)'s [Open Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct), but with some modifications.\n",

Eu consigo cobrir parte dos custos, mas para garantir o seu suave funcionamento, é necessária algum auxílio. Ninguém se deve sentir no dever de doar o que seja, porém àqueles e àquelas que têm a **possibilidade** e a vontade, qualquer ajuda é muito bem-vinda :)\n\nEis a página de LiberaPay onde é possível fazer um donativo: https://liberapay.com/lemmy.pt/  \n*Num futuro próximo vai ser estabelecido um repositório com registos mensais de donativos e despesas, de modo a existir maior transparência no financiamento da instância. Fiquem atentos.*\n\n---\n\n#### Matrix\n\nExiste uma sala na rede Matrix dedicado a esta instância de Lemmy. \nAqui, além de discussões sobre a instância, os administradores vão publicando avisos relativamente a problemas técnicos e interrupções de serviço.\nJunta-te a [`#tuga-lemmy:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#tuga-lemmy:matrix.org) para participares na conversa!\n\nExistem também outras salas portuguesas que podes ver aderindo ao espaço [`#espacotuga:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#espacotuga:matrix.org).\n\nTambém é possível entrar em contacto com os administradores através das mensagens privadas da plataforma, ou [por correio eletrónico](mailto:admin@lemmy.pt).\n\n---\n\n#### Traduzir o Lemmy\n\nSendo apologistas do movimento de *software* livre e da ideia de redes federadas, temos contribuído para o projecto através da tradução para Português. \nEste processo é realizado através da instância de Weblate (uma ferramenta de tradução, também ela livre) do projecto Lemmy, e que pode ser econtrada em https://weblate.join-lemmy.org\nQualquer sugestão de tradução é bem-vinda!\n\nDiscussão sobre a tradução do projecto pode ser feita na sala de Matrix acima referida, ou, alternativamente, numa outra sala sobre tradução em geral, em [`#tuga-traducao:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#tuga-traducao:matrix.org)\n\n--- \n\n#### Qualidade do serviço\n\n[![uptime](https://uptime.betterstack.com/status-badges/v1/monitor/gzc0.svg)](https://estado.lemmy.pt)\n\nÉ possível consultar o "uptime" do serviço em https://estado.lemmy.pt.',

MTGZone is a collection of Magic: the Gathering communities within the Lemmy social news network. \n\nWe have some basic rules community guidelines for membership and contributions here, and we hope you help make this community grow into a friendly, useful resource for fellow players and collectors!\n\n1. **Registrations are currently open!** \n\n   Email verification is required. \n\n   Due to spam/bot issues with Lemmy we also currently require that you answer one question and that an admin review all signups. We try to get to them asap and perhaps soon we'll remove this limitation and just enable captcha.\n\n   ---\n\n2. **Downvotes are enabled.** \n\n   Please reserve downvoting for content that doesn't contribute to the communities or discussions here, or for content you think doesn't belong.\n\n   ---\n\n3. **Communities are currently fixed** and not open for anyone to create. \n\n   We may open them up in the future but as we try to grow the user base we want to try to curate content a bit and keep the site focused for now.\n\n   ---\n\n4. **Please follow the [golden rule](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Golden_Rule)** in all interactions here! \n\n   Be kind to others and give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n   ---\n\n5. **Specific content rules:**\n   * **Keep it related to MTG!** All content must be related to the greatest game ever made, Magic: the Gathering.\n   * **No advertising.** Promoting your content is totally fine and encouraged, but direct commercial advertisements are not allowed.\n   * **No abusive language.** Swearing in general is not prohibited, but no direct insults toward other members.\n   * **No politics.** Please do not discuss general political news, issues, or the political views of others. The only exception is for things that very specifically relate to Magic: the Gathering **_the game_** or Wizards of the Coast's curation of **_the game_** itself. Discussion on [WOTC shareholder disputes](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/hasbro-rejects-finkel-alta-foxs-offer-to-spin-off-wotc-adds-two-new-board-members/) are fine as it affects the game, an artist's personal political views are not as it has no impact on the game. Please use your best judgment; we'll always explain decisions but will probably be fairly restrictive.\n   * **No pornography.** No nudity or pornographic alters, real or fictional.\n   * **No bigotry.** Everyone is welcome here. Please do not post content that outwardly or obviously targets others' race, religion, etc. Keep it kind, folks!\n\n   ---\n\n6. **Have fun!** \n\n   We're not Reddit and we specifically created this place as a greater alternative with the players and community as our sole interest.

Think of this as the comedy club's bouncer - he's here for everyone's safety, but he's also got a few good one-liners.\n\n**Content Guidelines**\n\nWe're all about the laughs here, but there are some jokes even we won't touch. No content that's illegal, violent, or hateful. If it's not something Mark Normand would joke about on stage, it probably doesn't belong here. That leaves it mostly wide open and if it’s witty enough it will land. \n\n**User Conduct**\n\nWe're a community, not a free-for-all. Be respectful, don't harass others, and remember - impersonation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it's also against our rules. And remember, if you're going to DM someone, don't be thirsty. Rejection is okay. Move on.\n\n**NSFW Content**\n\nWe're a NSFW community, but that doesn't mean anything goes. Keep it legal, and tag your content appropriately. If it's explicit, label it. If it's so explicit it could make a sailor blush, maybe reconsider posting it.\n\n**Privacy Policy**\n\nYour privacy is as important to us as a good punchline. We won't share your information, and we expect you to respect others' privacy too. Don't share or threaten to share intimate or explicit media of someone without their consent.\n\n**Enforcement**\n\nBreak the rules, and we've got a range of responses, from asking you nicely to knock it off, to a permanent ban. We're like a comedy club - we want everyone to enjoy the show, but we're not afraid to kick out hecklers. Remember, these terms are as flexible as a stand-up routine. We might change them from time to time, but we'll always keep you in the loop. ",

                "What is wetshaving? Modern wetshaving is made up of hobbyists who enjoy a wide range of shave soaps, aftershaves, shaving brushes, razors, and more. From modern to vintage, there's a great shave out there for everyone. We actually enjoy shaving!\n\nVisit the [wiki](https://wiki.wetshaving.social) to learn more and see if it might be something you'd like to try.

Consider for a moment that we're ALL on the the same rapidly-spinning, mostly-watery orb, hurtling through space at fantastic speeds, and trading metal and paper for our livelihoods. The unknown will always dwarf the known. Learning never ends. We may be experts in something, but no one person is an expert in all things. \n\nGiven that, here our are very simple\n\n# Rules\n\n**▪** Facts based in reality and science are not debatable.\n\n**▪** Opinions are great, just be ready to back yours up with a solid foundation of factual information and/or research.\n\n**▪** No NSFW communities are allowed to be created on this instance. \n\n**▪** Community creation is encouraged so long as it is actively moderated. \n\n**▪** Donations are not being accepted or expected. This rule may change IF the instance grows beyond current capacity. Please enjoy an ad-free, donation-free social media experience. \n\n**▪** Lastly, negative behaviors such as trolling, harassment, stalking, brigading, and other offensive behaviors as judged by the instance admin(s) will not be tolerated. Immediate and permanent bans are issued for spammers, trollers, vote brigaders, stalkers, harassers, and those of similar ilk. All decisions will be made by the instance admin(s). Those decisions are final and incontestable.  \n\nThat's the end of the boring but necessary stuff.\n\n# Alternate UIs\n\nWant a reddit-like experience?

The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies, individuals or other actors that are not affiliated with this instance.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.\n\nYou also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on bookwormstory.social, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.\n\n**What information do we collect?**\n\n- Basic account information: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture.

Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Aggregate user votes are viewable by admins and moderators of other instances on a per-comment basis and as such the entire user vote record of any individual user should be considered public. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy.\n\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.**\n\n- Direct messages: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it’s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.\n- IPs and other metadata: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. \n\n**What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n- To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people’s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n- To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n- The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n**How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm.\n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service.\n\nWe have additionally taken precautions to the best of our abilities to implement some other widely used industry best practices towards instance hardening and run daily encrypted remote backups.\n\n**What is our data retention policy?**\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.\n\nIn addition we retain a rolling 7 day backup policy on the entire instance.\n\n**Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n**Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. We may release your information only when we believe release is required to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n**Moderation**\n\nWhen using this instance be aware that moderation policies of the communities you use and the remote instances on which they are located apply in addition to this general policy.\n\nWe reserve the right to remove any content or account we deem any of the following:\n- in violation of any law applying to the server's hosting country (Germany)\n- very hostile to a healthy discussion climate\n\n**Site usage by children**\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\n**Contact**\n\nFor any sort of inquiry please send an email to [contact@bookwormstory.social](mailto:contact@bookwormstory.social).\n",

                'This privacy policy describes how endlesstalk.org ("endlesstalk.org", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the endlesstalk.org website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that endlesstalk.org does not own or control, or to individuals that endlesstalk.org does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n**You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on endlesstalk.org, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \\\n \\\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL\n\n\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nIf this server is in the EU or the EEA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\nIf this server is in the USA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, per the requirements of COPPA (Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act) do not use this site.\n\nLaw requirements can be different if this server is in another jurisdiction.',

Seriously, if you are in a heated argument and you feel like its personal, take a break.\n\n**No spamming/trolling**. We are here to interact and have fun. If you think trolling is fun, don't join here.\n\n**No advertising**. Accounts whose sole use is to advertise products or services will be banned.\n\n**Be civil**. You are not only representing yourself, but also this instance. Please be nice.\n\n**Keep it legal**. Don't use this instance to host illegal activities.\n\nThe admin receives all reports to your account, even from other instances/communities. Multiple genuine reports may trigger an evaluation of your account being banned.\n\nDue to a recent influx of spam accounts, registrations now require new users to tell me why they want to join this instance. The application will be used to manually spot repeated spammers. Users with throw-away email accounts will be denied.\n\n# Instance hosting\nHosted on non-rented Enterprise hardware at a datacentre near me.\n\nI strive to keep the system online 100%, however it is a hobby project so bear with me if there are problems.\n\nSnapshots are taken every 20 minutes and kept for 3 days. Immutable backups are performed nightly and kept for 12 months. Backups are replicated off-site to my home.\n\nMajor upgrades will be performed some weeks after they are made available, unless urgent (ie. security issue). This allows major bug reports to be actioned upon.\n\n# About me\nI work in the UK as an IT consultant with customers in the UK, EEA and the middle east.\n\nMy hobbies are Linux infrastructure, raising chickens, PC gaming and of course my great family  🥰 ",
